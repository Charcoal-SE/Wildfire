# flag-eventually
For queuing up flags, so as not to make moderators angry.

##Premise

Moderators don't like seeing a whole horde of flags in their precious flag queue. They dislike this even more when all the flags are from one user who is obviously running a search or query and flagging everything.

However, this bad content shouldn't be ignored. 

##Solution

This app (if it ends up actually existing) will allow you to 'queue up' flags, for dispensing at a sane pace. The flags will come from *your* account, not mine. This *does* mean I (or whoever hosts this) would theoretically be able to perform actions on your behalf. Weigh those risks... or just host it yourself.

Also, to combat the effects of something happening to a post that would make your previously valid flag invalid, we'll check the last activity date on the post.
